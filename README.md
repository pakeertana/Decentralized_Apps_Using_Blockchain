# Decentralized Apps Using Blockchain

This repository contains my learning journey into building decentralized applications (DApps) using **Ethereum**, **Solidity**, **Remix IDE**, and **Metamask**.  
I explored how smart contracts work, deployed them to the **Sepolia test network**, and connected simple frontend files with the blockchain.

---

## What I Learned
- Basics of **blockchain technology** and smart contracts.  
- Writing Solidity contracts like `storage.sol` and `bank.sol`.  
- Deploying contracts using **Remix IDE**.  
- Using **Metamask** for wallet management and test transactions.  
- Interacting with the blockchain from a simple frontend (`index.html`).  

---

## Project Structure
- `storage.sol` → a simple storage contract for learning.  
- `bank.sol` → a basic banking contract to understand deposits/withdrawals.
- `property.sol` → a basic property contract to understand the property availabity and buying.
- `voting.sol` → a basic voting contract to understand the list of candidates and number of votes earned by them.
- `bank/` → frontend folder containing `index.html` to interact with contracts.  
- `contract_frontend/` → setup with Node.js (package.json, lock file).  
- `artifacts/` → auto-generated build files from contract compilation.

## Tech Stack
- **Solidity** for writing smart contracts.  
- **Remix IDE** for development and deployment.  
- **Metamask** for Ethereum wallet & transaction signing.  
- **Sepolia Testnet** for contract deployment.  
- **HTML/JavaScript** for the frontend.

## Notes
This project is purely for **learning purposes**.  
It helped me understand how decentralized applications work end-to-end — from writing Solidity contracts to deploying them on Ethereum testnets.
